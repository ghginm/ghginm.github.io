# Notes

Notes are available on [GitHub Pages](https://ghginm.github.io/). Since my university days, I have encountered a great number of resources on mathematics, statistics, and machine learning, ranging from textbooks to YouTube videos that excel at simplifying complex concepts. The idea behind creating these notes is to organise hundreds of pages of lectures I have written, making them more concise. Hopefully, it could be useful not only to me but also to others.
